        <p>Here is my <strong>first entry.</strong></p>
        
        <p>First and foremost, I would like you to get the chance to know who I am. I am MegaStarWarsFan789. A programmer. An artist. A bookwriter. A stamp collector. A Minecrafter. A photographer. A trailer music lover. I am a Mega Star Wars Fan.<strong> I'm just a simple kid, trying to make my way in the universe.</strong></p>
        <p>I am a programmer, like I said. I started to program two years and one month ago (2019-08-14). It started when I was looking for some digital books to read through the library. I wanted a Star Wars book, and all of them on the website I was looking at I had either already read, or did not interest me.</p>
        <p><strong>But then something amazing happened.</strong></p>
        <p>There was a Star Wars book that I had not seen before. It was titled <em>"Star Wars Coding Projects Using Scratch"</em> </p>
        <p>I borrowed it, not knowing what it was.</p>
        <p>The book told me that I needed to go to a website named <a target="_blank" href= "https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a></p>
        <p><strong>So I  did just that.</strong></p>
        <p>And the rest is history.</p>
        
        <p>I learned to code in Scratch.</p>
        <p>Later, I began to try to learn Python.</p>
        <p>I wrote a few good programs, but I lacked the education for <em>actually</em> using it (I still do).</p>
        <p>I moved on to trying to learn HTML, but I still could not learn it well enough.</p>
        <p>Back to python.</p>
        
        <p>Eventually, I found Khan Academy.</p>
        
        <p>This has made all the difference for leaning text-based coding.</p>
        <p>I learned "Intro to JavaScript", now I'm learning "Intro to HTML/CSS"</p>
        <p>There was my first entry.</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h2 id= "second">Here I am, again.</h2>
        <h6>Posted on 10/13/2021</h6>
        
        <p>I was going to work on Khan Academy yesterday, but our power went out due to a huge rainstorm that happened two days ago.</p>
        
        <p>Raining sideways, trashcans rolling down the street, the rain was so thick, I could barely see anything through the window. Half of my grandma's tree fell over, denting two of her neighbor's garages.</p>
        <p>So, yeah, trees, branches, power lines, the whole bit. Power was out for a part of a day, a night, and another day</p>
        <p>The front of a house in my town got sheared off by a fallen tree.</p>
        <p>So, yeah! Sorry!</p>
